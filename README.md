## Purpose of this game

The purpose of this game is to practice web development skills that I'm currently learning. (3rd week of the course at the time of making this game).

The design is "relatively" responsive so it should work on mobile devices. At the time of writing this the only mobile device tested was a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and it worked.

This game may or may not get updated over time with extra features like A.I or online multiplayer mode as I learn more, depends on how busy I get with my other projects.

At the bottom of the Javascript file there is some code that is commented out. It's just a few things I was experimenting with. Mainly it's just there for my future self to look at how bad I was and how I improve over time :)
